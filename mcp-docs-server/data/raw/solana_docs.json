We will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.\n### YOUR CHOICES\n**Cookies**\nMost browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to disable cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. Likewise, most mobile devices allow you to disable the ability for geolocation information to be collected from your mobile device. The help function on most browsers and mobile devices contains instructions on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies, disable cookies entirely, or disable the collection of geolocation data. You need to set each browser, on each device you use to surf the Web. Thus, if you use multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.), you should repeat this procedure with each one. Similarly, if you connect to the Web from multiple devices (e.g., work and home), you need to set each browser on each device. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be able to utilize additional cookie management tools. Please note that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Website.\n**Communications Preferences**\nYou may opt out of receiving newsletters from Solana by following the instructions in those communications.\n### YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act or \"**_CCPA_** \" (Cal.

The commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back.\nIn descending order of commitment (most finalized to least finalized), clients may specify:\n  * `finalized` - the node will query the most recent block confirmed by supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized\n  * `confirmed` - the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by supermajority of the cluster.\n    * It incorporates votes from gossip and replay.\n    * It does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that block.\n    * This confirmation level also upholds \"optimistic confirmation\" guarantees in release 1.3 and onwards.\n  * `processed` - the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may still be skipped by the cluster.\n\n\nFor processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use `confirmed` commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total safety, it's recommended to use `finalized` commitment.\n### [Default Commitment](https://solana.com/docs/rpc#default-commitment)\nIf commitment configuration is not provided, the node will [default to `finalized` commitment](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/aa0922d6845e119ba466f88497e8209d1c82febc/sdk/src/commitment_config.rs#L199-L203)\nOnly methods that query bank state accept the commitment parameter. They are indicated in the API Reference below.\n## [RpcResponse Structure](https://solana.com/docs/rpc#rpcresponse-structure)\nMany methods that take a commitment parameter return an RpcResponse JSON object comprised of two parts:\n  * `context` : An RpcResponseContext JSON structure including a `slot` field at which the operation was evaluated.\n  * `value` : The value returned by the operation itself.\n\n\n## [Parsed Responses](https://solana.com/docs/rpc#parsed-responses)\nSome methods support an `encoding` parameter, and can return account or instruction data in parsed JSON format if `\"encoding\":\"jsonParsed\"` is requested and the node has a parser for the owning program. Solana nodes currently support JSON parsing for the following native and SPL programs:\nProgram | Account State | Instructions  \n---|---|---  \nAddress Lookup | v1.15.0 | v1.15.0  \nBPF Loader | n/a | stable  \nBPF Upgradeable Loader | stable | stable  \nConfig | stable |   \nSPL Associated Token Account | n/a | stable  \nSPL Memo | n/a | stable  \nSPL Token | stable | stable  \nSPL Token 2022 | stable | stable  \nStake | stable | stable  \nVote | stable | stable  \nThe list of account parsers can be found [here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/account-decoder/src/parse_account_data.rs), and instruction parsers [here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/transaction-status/src/parse_instruction.rs).\n## [Filter criteria](https://solana.com/docs/rpc#filter-criteria)\nSome methods support providing a `filters` object to enable pre-filtering the data returned within the RpcResponse JSON object. The following filters exist:\n  * `memcmp: object` - compares a provided series of bytes with program account data at a particular offset. Fields:\n    * `offset: usize` - offset into program account data to start comparison\n    * `bytes: string` - data to match, as encoded string\n    * `encoding: string` - encoding for filter `bytes` data, either \"base58\" or \"base64\". Data is limited in size to 128 or fewer decoded bytes.  \n**NEW: This field, and base64 support generally, is only available in solana-core v1.14.0 or newer. Please omit when querying nodes on earlier versions**\n  * `dataSize: u64` - compares the program account data length with the provided data size\n\n\nIs this page helpful?\n[Previous Terminology](https://solana.com/docs/references/terminology)[Next Data Structures as JSON](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/json-structures)\n[Configuring State Commitment](https://solana.com/docs/rpc#configuring-state-commitment)[Default Commitment](https://solana.com/docs/rpc#default-commitment)[RpcResponse Structure](https://solana.com/docs/rpc#rpcresponse-structure)[Parsed Responses](https://solana.com/docs/rpc#parsed-responses)[Filter criteria](https://solana.com/docs/rpc#filter-criteria)\n[Edit Page](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-com/blob/main/apps/web/content/docs/en/rpc/index.mdx)\nManaged by\n[](https://solana.com/)\n[](https://solana.com/youtube)[](https://solana.com/twitter)[](https://solana.com/discord)[](https://solana.com/reddit)[](https://solana.com/github)[](https://solana.com/telegram)\n© 2025 Solana Foundation.
